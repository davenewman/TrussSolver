# TrussSolver

TrussSolver is a GUI application for solving indeterminate trusses using the finite element method. Users input node location information (X-Y coordinates), member specific information (cross-sectional area, modulus of elasticity, and the nodes which the member connects), support constraints (free, fixed, horizontal roller, vertical roller), and applied loads. The application renders a visualization of the truss both before and after the determination of unknown variables. It returns the displacement of each node, unknown reaction forces, as well as "the" force and stress in each member.
